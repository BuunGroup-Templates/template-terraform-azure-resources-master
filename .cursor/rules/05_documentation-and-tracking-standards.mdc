### CHANGELOG.md

- A `CHANGELOG.md` file is required for every module and *must* be present in the module's root directory.
- It *must* be automatically used to track changes to all `.tf` files (often facilitated by commit hooks, see `06_tooling-and-git-integration.mdc`).
- *Must* follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](mdc:https:/semver.org).
- *Must* be updated after every major feature, breaking change, bug fix, or significant structural modification.

*Standard Format:*
```markdown
## [1.2.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- Support for precondition blocks.

### Changed
- BREAKING: `api_token` variable is now required unless provided via environment.

### Fixed
- Resolved issue with subnet creation in specific regions.
```

### Task Progress Tracking (TRACK.md)

To maintain a clear record of development activities, particularly when AI-assisted, a `TRACK.md` file *should* be maintained in the module's root. If not already present, it *should* be created by the developer or AI when significant work begins.

- This file is used to log significant actions, decisions, progress, and errors encountered by the AI or developer during the development or modification of the module.
- The AI *must* log its activities as detailed in `07_ai-assisted-workflow.mdc`.

**Example Entry Format:**
```markdown
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - Action/Task: Brief description of the action taken or task completed.
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - Observation/Decision: Note on an observation or decision made.
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - Error: Description of error encountered during `terraform plan/apply` or other steps.
```

### Documentation Standards (README.md)

- Every module root *must* include a `README.md`.
- Every example folder (e.g., `examples/default/`) *must* include its own `README.md`.
- Use `terraform-docs` to generate documentation consistently for inputs and outputs.

**Example in `examples/default/README.md`:**
```markdown
# Example: Default Usage

This example demonstrates default usage of the module with required and optional variables.

## Inputs

<!-- BEGIN_TF_DOCS -->
<!-- TERRAFORM_DOCS: INJECT -->
<!-- END_TF_DOCS -->


## Outputs

<!-- BEGIN_TF_DOCS_OUTPUTS -->
<!-- TERRAFORM_DOCS_OUTPUTS: INJECT -->
<!-- END_TF_DOCS_OUTPUTS -->
```

**Root `README.md` should include:**
- Purpose of the module.
- Prerequisites.
- Basic usage instructions.
- Links to examples.
- Inputs and Outputs sections (generated by `terraform-docs`).
- Information about developer setup if pre-commit hooks or other tools are used (see `06_tooling-and-git-integration.mdc`).
